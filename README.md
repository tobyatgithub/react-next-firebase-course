## React Basics - Hooks!

1. `useState()`

`useState()` is to hanlde react of data. Any data that changes in the application is called a state. And whenver a state changes, you want react to update the UI, so the latest change is reflected to the end user.

It takes one optional argument as the default state.

2. `useEffect()`

Component lifecycle: DidMount -> DidUpdate -> Will
Unmount

`useEffect()` runs every time a stateful data changes on a component (i.e. run when mounted, and run when state updates. )
